After installation, when booting the system and entering the setup assistant, the screen may go black and become unresponsive.  
At this point, you can wait a few minutes until the screen automatically lights up,  
or close the laptop lid, wait one or two minutes, then open it again. Once the screen lights up, you can continue.  

*This seems to be somewhat random. In any case, before completing the setup assistant, this is the only way to successfully boot.*
