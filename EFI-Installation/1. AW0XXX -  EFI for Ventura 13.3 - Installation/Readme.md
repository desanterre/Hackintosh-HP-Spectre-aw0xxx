This EFI configuration does **not** include drivers or patches necessary for full hardware support (e.g., audio, GPU, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).  
It is **only** intended to successfully boot the macOS installer and complete the installation process.  
After installation, the system will **fail to boot** during the final stage due to the lack of GPU drivers.  
At that point, you should switch to the **Post-Install EFI** to complete the setup wizard.
